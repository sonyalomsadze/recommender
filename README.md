# Building a Machine Learning Model for Product Recommendations Using Customer Purchase Data

This code is a simple implementation of a collaborative filtering recommendation system based on purchase history data. It uses several Python libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and SciPy.

The purchase history data is represented as a DataFrame with two columns: user_id and product_id. The code then counts the number of purchases for each user and product combination and converts the resulting table to a sparse matrix.

Using the cosine similarity metric, the code then computes a similarity matrix between the products. This similarity matrix is used to generate recommendations for each user based on their purchase history. Specifically, given a user_id, the code returns the top n products that the user has not already purchased, based on the user's purchase history and the similarity of each product to those purchased by the user.

The recommend_items function takes a user_id and an optional parameter n, which specifies the number of items to recommend. The function returns a list of recommended products.

The example usage of the recommend_items function shows how to generate recommendations for user 1. The output is a list of recommended items, which in this case are 'D', 'C', and 'E'.
